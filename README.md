GW-Core-War

Right now GW-Core-War is a tutorial for how to write your own REDCODE for the Core War game.  I want extend it to a collection of tools for writing, training, and fighting Redcode Warriors for the 1894 D. G. Jones and A. K. Dewdney Core-War programming game.

Right now we are using pmars, the standard mars.  Hopefully we will
switch to fmars or YACE.

GW-Core-War

GW-Core-War is a collection of tools for writing, training, and fighting 
Redcode Warriors for the 1894 D. G. Jones and A. K. Dewdney Core-War 
programming game.

It is built on top of fmars, probably the fastest Redcode Simulator.

Planned features
  - Documentation and guide on how to write a Warrior, run a simple
    simulations, and understand the output.  
  - Simple CLI for running fmars in standard configurations either with
    a parsed or unparsed files
  - A modern graphical display of the output of a match (may require
    either hacking fmars exensivly or using another simulator when
    graphics are being used.)
  - Implement multithreaded execution of matches in a tournament
  - Full C API with python bindings to run anything from two warriors in
    a simple enviornemnt to thousands of wariors efficanty for
    evolution

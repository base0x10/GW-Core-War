Morphogenesis is an evolver that generates Redcode Warriors for the
Core-War programming game using machine learning techniques.

I have done no work on this yet.  I anticipate using python for the
machine learning, likely with some relatively simple ML
frameworks/libraries.  I would love to use tensorflow, but I assume it
would be more work than this project requires.
